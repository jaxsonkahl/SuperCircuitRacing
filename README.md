## Harjot Sahota:

### *Feature 1:*
- Implemented a fully functional car with trail skid marks, particle-based skid smoke, raycast-based suspension, acceleration/steering physics, and surface detection for realistic movement and feedback.

- **Car:** https://github.com/jaxsonkahl/SuperCircuitRacing/pull/9  
- **Car Cinemachine:** https://github.com/jaxsonkahl/SuperCircuitRacing/pull/29  
- **Car Particles:** https://github.com/jaxsonkahl/SuperCircuitRacing/pull/30

### *Feature 2:*
- Implemented a countdown when the game starts. The player cannot move until "GO," which then enables movement and starts the race timer.

- **Commit:** https://github.com/jaxsonkahl/SuperCircuitRacing/pull/28

### *Feature 3:*
- Implemented collectible coins throughout the map. When collected, each coin reduces one second from the lap timer and displays a brief pop-up message.
